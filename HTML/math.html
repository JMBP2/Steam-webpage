	<center><h1>What is Math</h1></center>
	
	<p>Some philosophers think that "math is the science of quantity" which it has sense becuase maths is the origin of most of the things that nowadays we have, without maths we couldn't have things that help us to discover new things and make our life easier with the capability of desarrollating the critical thinking and logic. <br>
		
		<h3>what is studied in maths</h3>
	
		Math is the study of numbers, shapes, patterns and others that can help us to provides an effective way of building mental discipline; math has a very important relation with other subjects that can help us for understanding and discovering much more, some of- these are: physics, art, music, etc. which are also very imortant in life. </p>

	<center><h2>What is a function</h2></center>
	
	<p>Function, in mathematics, an expression or rule that defines a relationship between one variable which are the independent variable and the dependent variable; this relationship is commonly symbolized as y = f(x)—in other words “f of x”—and y and x are related such that for every x, there is a unique value.</p>
	
	<a><h3>The most “common” functions</h3></a>
	
	<p>In this image we can look some of the most “common” function in maths with their respective algebraic expression</p>
	
	<center><img src="../Imagenes/function.jpg" alt="commonfunction" width="100%" height="px" border="2px"></center>
	
<ul>
	
	<li>Linear function</li>
	<li>Quadratic function</li>
	<li>Absolute value function</li>
	<li>Cubic function</li>
	<li>Rational function</li>
		
		
	</ul>
	
	<p>All these functions are important but in this page we are going to focus in the 2 most important and most asked.</p>
	
	<h2>What is linear function</h2>
	
	<p>The linear function is a polynomial function that has the equation y=mx+b that always cuts Y at a point and also cuts X at a point.<br><br>
<li>m=Is equal to the slope of the function</li><br>
<li>n=is the ordinate to the function</li>
</p>

	<h3>Points of cut</h3>
	
<p>Y-axis cutoff point=Is the point of the line whose first coordinate is equal to 0<br><br>
X-axis cutoff point=is the point on the line that has 0 in the second coordinate. It is decrypted by setting the function equal to 0 and solving the equation obtained.
</p>
	
	<a><h4>EXAMPLE:</h4></a>
	<a>f (x) 7x-5</a>
	
	<a><h4>Y-axis cut:</h4></a>
	<a>f(0)=-5</a>
	
	<a><h4>Is the point:</h4></a>
	<a>(0,-5)</a>
	
	<h4>X-axis cut:</h4>
	<p>7x-5=0</p>
	<p>7x=5</p>
	<p>X=5/7</p>
	
	
	<a><h4>Is the point:</h4></a>
	<a>(5/7,0)</a>
	
	
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	
	
	<h2>What is a quadratic function</h2>
	
	<p>The quadratic function is a type of second-degree polynomial function.

Equation and function</p>

	<img src="../Imagenes/quadraticfunction.jpg" alt="formulaquadraticfunction" width="50%">
	
	<h3>Properties</h3>
	
	<ul>
	<li>The quadratic function conforms to a symmetric parabola with the vertical axis</li>
	<li>It can be positive or negative</li>
	<li>Will be concave if the sign is positive and will have a minimum in X, but if it is negative will be convex with a maximum at X</li>
	
	</ul>

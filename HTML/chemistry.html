	<center><h1>What is Chemistry</h1></center>
		
		<p>Chemistry as physics is a branch of science; chemistry is a subject that studies the properties of the of matter, structure of what are they made  for the purpose of using it on elements, compounds, mixtures, analyzing changes and possible thing that can happen.

		<h2>How to understand the periodic table</h2>
		
		<p>In the image below we can look more in detail how the elements are defined, in which we can find some important things that we need to take into consideration for doing exercises with the data given in the element; bonus (the periodic table has 118 elements).</p>
		
	  <center><img src="../Imagenes/Atomic Number.jpg" alt="periodictable" height="" width="50%"></center>
		
		<p>With the imformation of an element we can start understanding some things of the electronic configuration.</p>
		
		<h2>What is electronic configuration?</h2>
		
		<p>In chemistry, electronic configuration is a way in which we can understand how electrons can structure or organize in an atom.</p>
		
	  <center><img src="../Imagenes/electronicconfig.jpg" width="39%" alt="elecconfig"></center>
		
		<p>For doing the electronic configuration we use this grafic; we choose an element and then with the atomic number we start to creating this.</p>
		
		
	  <center><h2>CHEMICAL SOLUTIONS</h2></center>
		
	  <p>Chemistry is the science that studies the property of matter in order to create and discover new phenomena since chemistry is everywhere such as medicine, industry, environment, among others.</p>
		
		<h3>WHAT IT IS?</h3>
		
		<p>A solution is a mixture of two or more substances to form a homogeneous mixture that is when they lose their individual characteristics. It comes as solid, liquid and gas.</p>
		
		
		
		<center><img src="../Imagenes/Sloutions.jpg" width="49%" alt="elecconfig"></center>
		
	  <h3>CHARACTERISTICS</h3>
		
		
		<ul>
			
		<li>Its components cannot be divided by simple physical methods such as centrifugation, decantation, filtration, among others.</li>
		<li>Its components can only be separated by distillation, crystallization, chromatography.</li>
		<li>The components of a solution are solute and solvent.</li>
		
		</ul>
		
	<h4>Solute:</h4> <p>Which is dissolved by the solvent</p>
<h4>Dissolvent:</h4> <p>The one that dissolves the solute</p>
		
<p>For example, the sugar is dissolved by water. In this case, the sugar is the solute and the dissolvent is the water.</p>

<p>There are three types of concentration: Unsaturated, saturated and over-saturated</p>		
		
		
	<ul>
			
		<li>Unsaturated: when there is less solute than solvent.</li>
		<li>Saturated: when there is a balance between solute and solvent.</li>
		<li>Over-saturated: when there is more solute than solvent.</li>
		
	  </ul>	
		
		<center><img src="../Imagenes/solubility.jpg" width="60%" alt="elecconfig"></center>
		
		
	  <h3>FORMULA</h3>
		
		<li>C=m/V</li> <br>
<li>C=Concentration</li> <br>
<li>m= Mass of dissolved solute</li> <br>
<li>V= Total volume of solution</li> <br>

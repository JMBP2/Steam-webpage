	<h1>Virtual reality and augmented reality</h1>
	
	<p>Nowadays technology is a fundamental instrument in humanity that has been implemented little by little in everything that surrounds us, whether they are electronic devices, health, video games, and there is talk of virtual reality and augmented reality.</p>

	<h2>Virtual Reality</h2>
	
	<h4>What is virtual reality?</h4>
	
	<p>virtual reality is an environment where scenes and objects with a real appearance are seen. This is thanks to what today is called a virtual reality headset or glasses. In order to have a better experience.</p>

	<h4>Characteristics</h4>
	
	<ul>
	
	<li>It is an environment developed with three-dimensional graphics.</li>
	<li>It is dynamic.</li>
	<li>It is done and is interacted in real time.</li>
	
	
	</ul>
	
	<h4>Elements of virtual reality</h4>
<ul>
	
	<li>Software and content.</li>
	<li>virtual reality glasses.</li>
	<li>Controllers.</li>
	<li>Position sensors.
</li>
	
	
	</ul>

 <h4>Different types </h4>
	
	
	
<li>Non-immersive virtual reality: it is when the individual takes greater account that it is a simulated scenario. For example, in video games since its scenery and graphics reflect a sense of immersion.</li><br>
	
<li>Semi-immersive virtual reality: It is when the individual knows how to differentiate between what is real and what is simulated. for a better experience it relies on physical objects.</li><br>
	
<li>Immersive virtual reality: It is when the individual feels that he is actually in another world, it looks more futuristic with a high resolution that must be connected to a computer and that occupies the entire vision. For example, the PlayStation VR</li><br>

	<h3>Characteristics</h3>
	
	<ul>
	
	<li>Is in real time</li>
	<li>Combine the digital world with the real</li>
	<li>Relate all physical abilities</li>
	
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Difference between virtual ang augmented reality</h2>
	
	<p>Virtual reality disconnects from reality creating a totally new setting, while augmented reality introduces digital elements into the real world,</p>
